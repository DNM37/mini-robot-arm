# mini-robot-arm
 
I have always wanted to make a robot arm but I felt like it is a fairly common project. For that reason, this robot arm will be small, and I mean REALLY small...
There are a few more features that I would like to add to this project as well:
    -designing a controller to control the robot arm (would use potentiometers)
    -creating a computer interface to cnotrol the robot arm
    -implementing inverse kinematics to allow for smooth, precise motions.
    -hosting a website so other people can log in and control the arm :)
